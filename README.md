## Key Findings & Mitigation Tips

### ðŸ”¹ Host 10.0.0.1

* **IP Forwarding Enabled (Medium):** Disable IP forwarding unless explicitly required for routing.
* **DNS Cache Snooping (Medium):** Restrict DNS server access and configure query filtering.
* **Info Leaks:** Limit unnecessary network services and disable unused protocols.

### ðŸ”¹ Host 10.0.0.2

* **Node.js Vulnerabilities (Critical/High):** Upgrade Node.js to the latest patched release.
* **Ruby RACK DoS (Medium):** Update Rack to version â‰¥ 2.2.14 / 3.x patched releases.
* **SSL Certificate Issues (Medium):** Replace untrusted/expired certificates with CA-signed ones.
* **Service/Software Enumeration:** Apply least privilege, firewall restrictions, and disable unneeded services.

### ðŸ”¹ Host 10.0.0.3

* **Informational Findings Only:** No immediate risk; monitor system regularly and keep software updated.
